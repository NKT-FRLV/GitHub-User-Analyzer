## üîß Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account with PostgreSQL database
- GitHub API access token
- (Optional) OpenAI API access token for enhanced code analysis

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/wonder.git
cd wonder
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables in a `.env` file:

```
# Connect to Supabase via connection pooling
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@aws-0-region.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"

# Direct connection to the database. Used for migrations
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:password@aws-0-region.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# GitHub API
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_github_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Admin credentials
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email

# JWT secrets
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_at_least_32_chars
REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret_at_least_32_chars

# OpenAI (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

4. Initialize the database and run migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset -f
```

5. Seed the database with initial data:

```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

6. Run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: http://localhost:3000

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `app/` - Application source code (Next.js App Router)
  - `api/` - API routes and backend utilities
  - `components/` - React components
  - `context/` - Application context for global state
  - `lib/` - Libraries and utilities
  - `types/` - TypeScript types
- `prisma/` - Database schema and migrations
- `public/` - Static files

### Authentication

The application implements JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens. Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies for security.

- `/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `/auth/login` - Log in to the system
- `/auth/logout` - Log out of the system

### Candidate Management

- `/candidates` - Page with a list of saved candidates
- `/api/candidates` - API for saving and removing candidates

### Developer Analysis

- AI-powered insights highlight key strengths and areas for improvement
- Language proficiency detection across all repositories
- Code quality assessment based on repository structure and patterns
- Contribution history analysis to understand consistency and work habits

### Repository Exploration

- Detailed repository analysis with AI feedback
- Code architecture evaluation
- Best practices assessment
- Performance optimization suggestions
